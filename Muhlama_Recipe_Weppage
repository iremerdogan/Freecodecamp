        <ol>
          <li>First, dice the kolot cheese and set it aside. Kolot cheese is generally used for muhlama, but you can also use other melting cheeses like çeçil cheese or cheddar cheese if you prefer.</li>
          <li>Next, add the butter to a pan and let it melt over the stove.</li>
          <li>Once the butter has melted, add the cornmeal and stir while toasting it. Make sure the heat is not too high during this step.</li>
          <li>After toasting the cornmeal for 1-2 minutes, add the water.</li>
          <li>Once the mixture reaches a creamy consistency, add the diced cheese and continue cooking over low heat until the cheese melts.</li>
          <li>Once the cheese has melted, your muhlama is ready to serve. This easy-to-make and incredibly delicious muhlama recipe is a must-try. Enjoy!</li>
